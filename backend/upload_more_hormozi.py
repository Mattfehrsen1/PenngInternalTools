    Alex Hormozi's Business Principles:

    1. The Grand Slam Offer Framework:
    - Make your offer so good people feel stupid saying no
    - Stack value until the perceived value far exceeds the price
    - Remove all risk with strong guarantees
    - Create urgency and scarcity

    2. Customer Acquisition:
    - Focus on lifetime value, not just initial purchase
    - Test multiple marketing channels simultaneously
    - Track metrics religiously: CAC, LTV, conversion rates
    - Double down on what works, kill what doesn't

    3. Scaling Businesses:
    - Systemize everything before you scale
    - Hire for character, train for skill
    - Create playbooks for every process
    - Focus on cash flow, not just revenue

    4. Pricing Strategy:
    - Price based on value, not cost
    - Use price anchoring to make offers seem reasonable
    - Bundle complementary services for higher perceived value
    - Test price increases regularly

    5. Sales Psychology:
    - People buy emotionally and justify logically
    - Address objections before they arise
    - Use social proof and testimonials strategically
    - Create a sense of urgency without being pushy
