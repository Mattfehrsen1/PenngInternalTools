# ðŸ”§ ElevenLabs Agent Fix - Use Function Results

## ðŸš¨ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
Your backend is working perfectly! When tested directly, the webhook returns rich content with 5 citations from Alex Hormozi books. The issue is that the ElevenLabs agent is calling the function but **NOT using the results** in its responses.

## âœ… **BACKEND STATUS: PERFECT** 
- âœ… Persona mapping: "default" â†’ Alex Hormozi (31 files)
- âœ… RAG service: Finding results for all queries  
- âœ… Webhook: Returning rich content with citations
- âœ… Performance: 4-second response time with caching

## ðŸŽ¯ **THE FIX: Update Agent System Prompt**

Go to your ElevenLabs agent dashboard and replace the system prompt with this **much stronger** version:

### **NEW SYSTEM PROMPT (Copy this exactly):**

```
You are Alex Hormozi, a successful entrepreneur and business coach. You speak directly, focus on actionable advice, and help people build profitable businesses.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR KNOWLEDGE BASE ACCESS:
- You MUST call the query_persona_knowledge function for ANY question that could be answered from your knowledge base
- This includes questions about business, money, wealth, offers, leads, value, strategies, or any entrepreneurial topic
- When the function returns results, you MUST use that content in your response
- ALWAYS include information from the function results when available
- If the function returns citations, mention the sources (like "According to my book $100M Offers...")
- Never say "I don't have information" if the function returns content

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Start with the knowledge from your function call results
- Add your own commentary and insights
- Keep responses under 200 words for voice delivery
- Be conversational but authoritative
- Use specific examples and numbers when provided by the function

FUNCTION CALLING RULE:
- Call query_persona_knowledge for every substantive question
- Use the returned content as the foundation of your response
- Only say you don't have information if the function truly returns no results
```

## ðŸ”§ **ADDITIONAL FIXES**

### 1. **Check Function Configuration**
Ensure your webhook is configured exactly like this in the ElevenLabs Tools section:

**URL:** `https://clone-api.fly.dev/elevenlabs/function-call`
**Method:** `POST`
**Headers:**
```
X-Service-Token: NVhAvjqhHixz8liX47R4qJze9l236Rquu7pjfL7fLD0
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body Parameters:**
```json
{
  "function_name": "query_persona_knowledge",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "[USER_QUERY]",
    "persona_id": "default"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Test Questions That Should Work Now**
After updating the prompt, test with:
- "What does your knowledge base say about getting rich?"
- "Tell me about Alex Hormozi's approach to offers"
- "What's in your knowledge base about building businesses?"
- "Share some insights about making money"

### 3. **Expected Behavior**
The agent should now:
âœ… Call the function for knowledge questions
âœ… Use the returned content in responses  
âœ… Mention sources like "According to my book $100M Offers..."
âœ… Provide specific details from the knowledge base
âœ… Stop saying "I don't have information" when data exists

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING VERIFICATION**

Your backend webhook is proven to return this for "getting rich":
```
"This knowledge can make you millions. You get to learn while you earn - score... 
$400 product â†’ 5 customers per week x $400 each = $2000/wk... 
Remember, we want to get rich, not just get by."
```

With the new prompt, the agent should incorporate this content instead of saying it doesn't have information.

## ðŸŽ‰ **RESULT**
After this fix, users should be able to ask about business, money, wealth building, etc. and get responses that include content from Alex Hormozi's uploaded books with proper citations.

The voice-enabled AI clone with real knowledge base access will finally be **fully functional**!
