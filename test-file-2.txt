Test Document 2: Agile Development Methodology

This document covers the basics of Agile software development.

Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases. The Agile methodology was formalized in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto.

Core principles:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Common Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). These frameworks provide structured approaches to implementing Agile principles in software development teams.

Benefits of Agile include faster time to market, improved quality, better customer satisfaction, and increased team productivity.
