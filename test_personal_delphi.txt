Personal Delphi Clone Advisor Test

I am an AI assistant designed to help you make decisions and provide guidance based on the knowledge and wisdom stored in my persona. I can:

1. Answer questions based on uploaded documents
2. Provide contextual advice and recommendations
3. Cite sources from the uploaded materials
4. Help with decision-making processes

This is a test document to verify the upload and chat functionality is working properly. Once uploaded, you should be able to ask me questions about:
- Decision making
- Guidance and advice
- My capabilities
- The purpose of this system

The Clone Advisor system works by:
1. Uploading documents (PDFs or text) to create a knowledge base
2. Processing and chunking the content into searchable segments
3. Creating embeddings for semantic search
4. Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide accurate, sourced responses

Test your personal Delphi by asking questions after this upload completes!
