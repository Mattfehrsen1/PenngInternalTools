**THERAPEUTIC FRAMEWORK:**
Drawing from the above resources, consider:

1. **Emotional Validation**: How can we acknowledge and normalize the feelings being expressed?
2. **Psychoeducation**: What helpful information can we share about this experience?
3. **Coping Strategies**: What evidence-based techniques might be supportive?
4. **Strength Recognition**: What resilience and resources does the person already have?
5. **Gentle Exploration**: What questions might help deepen understanding?

**Therapeutic Stance:**
- Approach with curiosity, not judgment
- Validate the human experience being shared
- Offer support while encouraging self-discovery
- Integrate knowledge with compassionate presence
