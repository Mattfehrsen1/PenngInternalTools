The Value Stack Formula by Alex Hormozi

The Value Stack is a powerful framework for creating irresistible offers that convert prospects into customers. Here's the complete formula:

1. Dream Outcome
   - What is the ultimate result your prospect wants?
   - Paint a vivid picture of their ideal future state
   - Make it tangible and emotionally compelling

2. Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
   - How certain are they that YOUR solution will get them there?
   - Use proof elements: testimonials, case studies, guarantees
   - Remove risk and uncertainty

3. Time Delay
   - How quickly can they achieve the dream outcome?
   - Faster = more valuable
   - Instant gratification beats delayed results

4. Effort and Sacrifice
   - How much work do they need to put in?
   - What do they need to give up?
   - Less effort + less sacrifice = higher value

The Value Equation:
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)

To create a Grand Slam Offer:
- Maximize the numerator (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood)
- Minimize the denominator (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)

Key Strategies:
1. Stack multiple solutions to one problem
2. Add bonuses that eliminate obstacles
3. Create scarcity and urgency
4. Use risk reversal (guarantees)
5. Price for value, not for cost

Remember: The goal is to make an offer so good that people feel stupid saying no.
